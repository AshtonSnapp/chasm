# Ashton Snapp's Open Source Code of Conflict

Whatever FOSS project of mine you may be contributing to, the code you contribute will be (hopefully carefully) reviewed, and critiqued as necessary. Chances are, your code may need alterations in order to improve it. This is done to make sure all the ode that enters the project is the best it can be, as we don't want any code to degrade the quality of the overall software package.

However, if during the code review process, you feel personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable, that simply won't do. If that ever turns out to be the case, please contact me so I can help resolve the situation to the best of my abilities.

This Code of Conflict applies even if this file is edited maliciously. The version on my website is the backup.
